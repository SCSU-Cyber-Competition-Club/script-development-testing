# Automates the installation of the Splunk Universal Forwarder. Currently set to v10.0.1. I'm not sure if the link will be valid during the entire CCDC season
# with how much is still left to go. If the download gives you any trouble, create a Splunk account, go to the universal forwarder downloads, pick the one you want,
# then extract the random set of characters found in the link. In this script, these are stored in the variable "SPLUNK_BUILD".
#
# Please note that no monitors, besides a sample test one, are included. My team is using some custom tooling we'd like to keep private for now, and I want to encourage
# people to learn at least a little bit of Splunk to make use of this script. My only request for using this script is that if you ever make any improvements, please share
# them with the community. This will not be enforced with a license.
#
#
# This was put together as an amalgamation of code from my own work, other automatic installation scripts, and lots of tears.
# Lots time went into this script. Be nice to it plz <3
